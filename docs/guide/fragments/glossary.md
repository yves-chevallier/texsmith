# Glossary

In online documentation, glossary doesn't have much sense, since you can
search for terms directly and you have hyperlinks. However, in printed documents, a
glossary can be very useful to provide definitions of terms used in the text.

TeXSmith adds support for glossaries through the `glossary` extension, which
allows you to define glossary entries in your Markdown files and generate a
glossary section in the output document.
