# Length and Geometry

Choosing paper layout and geometry is an important part of document preparation. This guide covers the basics of setting up page dimensions, margins, and other geometric properties in your documents.

Depending on the template you are using, there may be different ways to configure geometry. TeXSmith provides a flexible way to manage these settings through the front matter of your Markdown files. It relies on the LaTeX `geometry` package to handle page layout and the `ts-geometry` fragment to apply these settings.
