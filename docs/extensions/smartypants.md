# Smarty Pants

This extension is a port of the Python Markdown SmartyPants extension. It translates plain ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example, it converts straight quotes into curly quotes, double hyphens into en dashes, and triple hyphens into em dashes.
