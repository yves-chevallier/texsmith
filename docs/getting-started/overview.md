# Overview

## What is TeXSmith?

**TeXSmith** is a Markdown to LaTeX converter designed to simplify the process of creating LaTeX documents from Markdown files. It supports a wide range of Markdown features and provides additional functionalities to enhance the LaTeX output. It doesn't depend on Pandoc, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Does TeXSmith reinvent the wheel?

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) is certainly a powerful tool - the perhaps THE tool -- for converting Markdown to LaTeX, but by default it doesn't support the full range of Markdown extensions used in Docusaurus, MkDocs, and other popular documentation frameworks. Adding and customizing these extensions in Pandoc can be complex and time-consuming. Moreover Pandoc is a Java-based tool that requires a separate installation.

The primary goal of TeXSmith is to focus and specialize in converting Markdown documents, particularly those generated by MkDocs, into LaTeX format.

## What is the status of TeXSmith?

TeXSmith is a young baby not even full grown teeth yet. It is still under active development, and new features are being added regularly. While it already supports a wide range of Markdown features, there are still some advanced LaTeX functionalities that are yet to be implemented. My goal is to make it reliable and feature-complete for most common use cases.

Soon (yes you know what "soon" means in software development) TeXSmith will be released in a mature version 1.0.0. Help and contributions are welcome tough.
