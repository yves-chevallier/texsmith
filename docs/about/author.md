I'm Yves Chevallier, the creator and maintainer of TeXSmith. I work full-time as an associate professor at [HEIG-VD](https://www.heig-vd.ch) in Switzerland, where I teach software engineering. My research interests revolve around software architecture, meta-generation, and—naturally—documentation tooling. Before drifting into academia, I trained as an electronics engineer with a focus on real-time embedded systems for motion-control applications.

I originally built TeXSmith mostly for fun -- and partly to see how far AI-assisted tooling can be pushed. Judging by the pace of progress, this was probably a terrible idea: my job may well be obsolete in a few years.
