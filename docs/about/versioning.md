# Versioning

TeXSmith follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Each release version is identified by a three-part number: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. We will therefore ensure that no breaking changes are introduced in minor or patch releases.

However, versions prior to `1.0.0` are considered initial development releases, and as such, the public API may change at any time without notice. Users are advised to expect potential breaking changes when upgrading between pre-1.0.0 versions. As not near yet from a stable release, TeXSmith is not recommended for production use at this time. Testing and feedback from early adopters is highly appreciated to help us improve the tool.
