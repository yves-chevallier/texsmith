# Smarty Pants

This extension ports the Python-Markdown SmartyPants behavior. It swaps
plain ASCII punctuation for typographically “smart” equivalents—straight quotes
become curly quotes, `--` becomes an en dash, and `---` turns into an em dash.
The substitutions happen in both HTML and LaTeX output, so your prose looks
polished everywhere.
