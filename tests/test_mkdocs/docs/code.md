# Code Samples

Simple examples for code rendering features.

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b
```

Inline snippets such as `sum(range(10))` should stay wrapped in `<code>`.

```bash
echo "shell block"
```

Superfences with alternate syntax highlighting:

````
```json
{"valid": true, "count": 3}
```
````
