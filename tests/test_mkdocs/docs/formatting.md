# Formatting Showcase

This page demonstrates basic inline formatting utilities available in Markdown.

Paragraphs can mix **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, and ==highlighted==
segments inside the same sentence. Inline code such as `print("highlight")`
should remain wrapped in `<code>` tags.

> Quotes should render with `<blockquote>` elements in the generated HTML.

- Plain list items stay simple.
- Items may include **bold** text.
- Tasks work too:
  - [x] Completed
  - [ ] Pending

Links like [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) should become anchor tags.

Here's a definition list sample:

Term
