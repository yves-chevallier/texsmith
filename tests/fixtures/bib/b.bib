abstract = {The single most important factor in the control of cheese quality is the acid production in the vat, because this largely determines the characteristic basic structure of the cheese and, for most cheese varieties, pH. Any specific cheese variety can be classified by its normal range of calcium content and pH. The pH at draining also determines proportions of residual chymosin (calf rennet) and plasmin in the cheese. Activities of these two enzymes play a major part in degradation of cheese caseins during ripening and in consequent development of characteristic cheese flavor. Rate of proteolysis also is influenced by the ratio of moisture to casein and the ratio of salt to moisture. Uniform cheese quality can be achieved routinely only by cheese made within specified ranges of chemical composition. These should include specification for the normal range of calcium content to be expected in a traditional variety, because this, together with pH, will be an indication that acid production up to the draining stage was normal. The use of calcium data in cheese specifications should improve the prediction rate when young cheese is graded to assess its probable quality at maturity. Acid production can be under complete control only if defined starter systems are used. The development in New Zealand of the “multiple strain” and “single pair” concepts is described.}

abstract = {Microorganisms are an essential component of all natural cheese varieties and play important roles during both cheese manufacture and ripening. They can be divided into two main groups; starters and secondary flora. The starter flora, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii used either individually or in various combinations depending on the cheese variety, are responsible for acid development during cheese production. Starters may be either blends of defined strains or, as in the case of many cheeses manufactured by traditional methods, composed of undefined mixtures of strains which are either added at the beginning of manufacture or are naturally present in the cheese milk. During cheese ripening, the starter culture, along with the secondary flora promote a complex series of biochemical reactions which are vital for proper development of both flavour and texture. The secondary flora is composed of complex mixtures of bacteria, yeasts and moulds, and is generally specifically associated with particular cheese varieties. In many cheese varieties, the action of the secondary flora contributes significantly to the specific characteristics of that particular variety. The secondary flora may be added in the form of defined cultures, but in many situations is composed of adventitious microorganisms gaining access to the cheese either from ingredients or the environment. During cheese manufacture and ripening, complex interactions occur between individual components of the cheese flora. Environmental factors within the cheese also contribute to these interactions. Elucidation of such interactions would greatly add to our understanding of the cheese ripening process and would enable a more targeted approach to starter/adjunct selection for cheese quality improvement. In the past, research in this area was dependent on classical microbiological techniques, which are very time consuming, not suitable for handling large numbers of isolates and generally not suitable to studies at sub species levels. However, developments in this area have recently undergone a major revolution through the development of a range of molecular techniques, which enable rapid identification of individual isolates to species and strain level. Application of such techniques to the study of cheese microbiology should lead to major advances in understanding this complex microbial ecosystem and its impact on cheese ripening and quality in the coming years.}

abstract = {Summary
Endurance limits, measured as the maximum sustainable rate of caloric expenditure, constrain human performance from athletics to manual labor. Early work on the metabolic limits of humans and other species focused on establishing a single estimate for maximal sustained expenditure, often expressed as a multiple of basal metabolic rate (BMR; kcal/day)1,2,3,4 and known as “metabolic scope” (MS). More recently, Thurber and colleagues5 proposed a duration-dependent metabolic ceiling for humans, in which the limit of sustained expenditure falls in a semi-log manner from ∼10× BMR for events lasting 1 day and reaches an asymptote of ∼2.5× BMR at approximately 28 weeks. We tested this metabolic ceiling model in 14 highly trained, elite, and world class6 ultra-endurance athletes (12 males and 2 females; 37.2 ± 7.0 years). We measured MS (total energy expenditure [TEE]/BMR) using doubly labeled water during ultra-endurance competitions spanning ∼24 h to ∼13 days, and lower- and higher-workload training weeks, to generate predictive equations for MS as a function of exercise volume. We then applied these equations to participants’ training records to calculate their maximum MS for 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 30-, and 52-week periods. Maximum MS for competitions and training periods up to 12 weeks approached, but never exceeded, the proposed metabolic ceiling. Four athletes exceeded 2.5× BMR at 30 and 52 weeks (maximum: 2.74), but mean MS for the sample at 30 weeks (2.43 ± 0.17; TEE: 4,085 ± 642 kcal/day) and 52 weeks (2.39 ± 0.17; TEE: 4,020 ± 641 kcal/day) did not exceed the proposed limit. These results suggest that exceeding the hypothesized duration-dependent limit of energy expenditure is rare.}
