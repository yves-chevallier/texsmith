# TeXSmith Logos Extension

This small demo page illustrates the HTML output produced by the `texsmith-texlogos`
extension. Each keyword below is produced by simply typing the plain text variant in a
Markdown paragraph:

| Command | Markdown Input | Rendered HTML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\TeX{}` | `TeX` | TeX |
| `\LaTeX{}` | `LaTeX` | LaTeX |
| `\LaTeXe{}` | `LaTeX2e` | LaTeX2ε |
| `\TeX{}\textsc{Smith}` | `TeXSmith` | TeXSmith |

In Markdown simply type the names with the correct capitalization:

```markdown
TeX, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, and TeXSmith are all rendered with their
respective logo macros.
```
