You are performing final integration cleanup after the refactors land.

Tasks:
1. Audit the codebase for straggling imports that reference removed modules (e.g., `texsmith.domain.*` or old service helpers). Fix or delete them.
2. Run the full automated test suite, lint checks, and type checks (`pytest`, `ruff`/`flake8`, `pyright` if configured). Address any failures introduced by the refactors.
3. Update documentation, changelog, and developer guides to describe the new architecture, the `ConversionService` API, the template rendering workflow, and the diagnostics interface. Include migration notes for external users.
4. Ensure example scripts, mkdocs configuration, and templates still work END-TO-END by running at least one representative conversion example (markdown + template) and verifying the output.
5. Prepare a release checklist: highlight breaking changes, new APIs, removed modules, and recommended upgrade path. Capture this in `DEVEL.md` or a new `UPGRADE.md` file.

Acceptance criteria:
- Repository is clean (no unused compatibility shims or outdated docs).
- Quality gates (tests, lint, type check) pass locally.
- Documentation clearly explains the new structure and gives guidance for downstream consumers.
