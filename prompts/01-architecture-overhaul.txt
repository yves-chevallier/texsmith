You are refactoring the package layout to remove compatibility shims and expose a clear core API. Perform the following actions:

1. Introduce a top-level `texsmith/core` (or reuse `texsmith/domain/conversion` if simpler) module that houses the conversion engine, context objects, templates, and bibliography helpers. All engine code should live here; imports from `texsmith.domain.*` need to be rewritten to point at the canonical location. Keep relative imports consistent and avoid circular dependencies.
2. Delete the compatibility facades that simply re-export symbols: `texsmith/conversion.py`, `texsmith/context.py`, `texsmith/templates/__init__.py`, `texsmith/domain/conversion/__init__.py`, and the CLI indirection modules in `texsmith/cli/commands/` that forward to `texsmith/ui/cli/commands/`. Adjust package `__init__` files so everything still imports correctly.
3. Update `texsmith/__init__.py` to re-export the curated public API directly from the new module locations. Make sure lazy imports are still possible where they add value, but avoid excessive indirection.
4. Run the test suite to confirm there are no missing imports. Fix any failures or warnings caused by the package moves. Do not skip tests that cover the conversion pipeline or CLI.
5. Update documentation (`README.md`, `DEVEL.md`, mkdocs navigation) if directory paths or import examples changed.

Acceptance criteria:
- No module keeps the old `texsmith.domain` compatibility layer; imports resolve to the real implementation without runtime monkey-patching.
- All public imports from `texsmith` and `texsmith.api` continue to work in the same way for external callers.
- Tests and linters pass.
