You are redesigning slot selection so all entry points share a single data model.

Tasks:
1. Create a `DocumentSlots` (or equivalent) abstraction that stores slot inclusions, selector overrides, and wildcard/full-document directives. It should support merging multiple sources of directives (front matter, CLI flags, programmatic overrides).
2. Update document preparation to build a `DocumentSlots` instance for each document. Replace `Document.assign_slot`, `slot_overrides`, and `slot_inclusions` with methods on the new abstraction.
3. Adjust `build_binder_context` and any other consumers to rely on `DocumentSlots` rather than recalculating slot mappings. Ensure full-document slots and partial selectors are handled consistently.
4. Remove `apply_slot_assignments` and any duplicated slot parsing logic. Tests that previously asserted on `slot_overrides` should now validate `DocumentSlots` behaviour.
5. Verify the CLI still supports `--slot` options, and front-matter slot declarations are honoured. Add regression tests covering multiple slot targets, wildcard selectors, and missing section warnings.

Acceptance criteria:
- Slot directives are represented by a single type across the codebase.
- No module maintains duplicate data structures for slot inclusions vs overrides.
- All tests related to slot behaviour pass and explicitly cover the new abstraction.
