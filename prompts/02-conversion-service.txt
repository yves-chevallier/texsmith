You are building a cohesive conversion orchestration layer to replace the procedural helpers in `texsmith.api.service` and `texsmith.api.pipeline`.

Tasks:
1. Define `ConversionRequest` and `ConversionResponse` dataclasses that capture all inputs and outputs for a conversion run (source paths, bibliography paths, slot directives, render options, template identifier, debug flags, etc.).
2. Implement a `ConversionService` class that exposes `prepare_documents()` and `execute()` methods. Internally, the service should encapsulate logic currently spread across `split_document_inputs`, `prepare_documents`, `apply_slot_assignments`, `build_render_settings`, `build_callbacks`, and `execute_conversion`.
3. Replace any direct calls to the old helper functions inside the CLI (`texsmith/ui/cli/commands/*.py`) and tests with the new service methods. Preserve behaviour such as markdown extension resolution, bibliography handling, and template session usage.
4. Remove the redundant helper functions after the service is adopted. Keep utility functions that still make sense (e.g., `_deduplicate_paths`) but relocate them into a private module if needed.
5. Add focused unit tests for `ConversionService` that cover markdown vs HTML inputs, slot overrides, template execution, and error propagation. Update existing tests to use the new API.

Acceptance criteria:
- `texsmith.api.service` becomes a thin façade around `ConversionService` or is replaced entirely by the class.
- The CLI and other callers depend on the new service without duplicating orchestration logic.
- Tests document the expected inputs and outputs for the service and continue to cover both template and non-template scenarios.
