You are replacing the optional callback bag with a concrete diagnostics interface.

Tasks:
1. Define a `DiagnosticEmitter` protocol (or abstract base class) with methods like `warning(message, exc=None)`, `error(message, exc=None)`, and `event(name, payload)`. Provide at least two implementations: `NullEmitter` (no-op) and `CliEmitter` (bridges to the existing CLI logging utilities).
2. Refactor the conversion pipeline (`texsmith/core/conversion/debug.py` or similar once the package move is complete) to depend on the new interface. Remove `ConversionCallbacks`, `_emit_warning`, `_fail`, and related helpers after the interface is adopted.
3. Update `ConversionService`, the CLI, and tests to construct and pass the appropriate emitter. Ensure debug flag handling still works (e.g., raising on errors when debugging is enabled).
4. Replace direct logging calls with the emitter where appropriate, but keep Python logging for unexpected internal failures if needed.
5. Add unit tests for the emitters and integration tests that ensure warnings, errors, and structured events are captured correctly in both CLI and library scenarios.

Acceptance criteria:
- No code paths rely on `ConversionCallbacks`.
- Diagnostics flow through a single, well-defined interface that can be mocked in tests.
- CLI output and debug behaviour remain unchanged from a user perspective.
