# Admonitions

This demo compares several callout styles (fancy, classic and minimal). It validates rendering and alternate engines (tectonic, xelatex) stay consistent.

Color emojis are note compatible with some LaTeX engines (notably xelatex). In such cases, the icon will be rendered in black and white.

## Build

```sh
make clean all # builds with tectonic by default
```
