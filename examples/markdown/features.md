# TeXSmith Markdown Syntax

## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Markdown syntax features and extensions supported by TeXSmith. It serves as a reference guide for users looking to leverage Markdown's capabilities in their documents. This is meant to be a cheatsheet of supported features and a test suite for custom templates.

## Core Markdown (Standard "Vanilla")

### Headings

Demonstrates the Markdown heading hierarchy from level 1 to level 5. Note that in Markdown only six levels are defined: `#` to `######`. In LaTeX, however, there are less levels (e.g., `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection`, `\paragraph`, `\subparagraph`). The last one is usually simply converted to bold text.

```md
# Heading 1

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## Heading 2

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

### Heading 3

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

#### Heading 4

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

##### Heading 5

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
```

#### Heading 4

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

##### Heading 5

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

### Bold

Shows how to emphasise text with bold weight. Simply translated to `\textbf{…}` in LaTeX.

```md
**text** or __text__ or **t**ex**t**
```

> **text** or __text__ or **t**ex**t**

### Italic

Applies emphasis for terminology or voice.

```md
This _text_ is italic.
```

> This _text_ is italic.

### Strikethrough

Marks text as deleted or obsolete.

```md
We ~~do not~~ want this. 
```

> We ~~do not~~ want this.

### Underline

With caret, mark and tilde extension from PyMdownX it is also possible to underline text.

```md
^^text^^
```

> ^^text^^


### Inline Code / Code Blocks

````md
This entry is `inline code`, or can be in a fenced code block:

```python
print("Hello")
```
````

> This entry is `inline code`, or can be in a fenced code block:
>
> ```python
> print("Hello")
> ```

### Hyperlinks

Creates external hyperlinks, in PDF converted to clickable links.

```md
The German-bord pysicist [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is famous for
his nobel prize and the theory of relativity.
```

> The German-bord pysicist [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is famous for
> his nobel prize and the theory of relativity.

### Images

Embeds remote or local images.

```md
![Random Picture](https://picsum.photos/500/200)
```

> ![Random Picture](https://picsum.photos/500/200)

### Lists

```

```

>     1. Sub-numbered
>         a. Sub-sub-numbered
>         b. Sub-sub-numbered

## TeXSmith Markdown Extensions

TeXSmith features several custom Markdown extensions to enhance document authoring. 
Below is a summary of the supported extensions along with their usage.

### Small Capitals

With standard Markdown `**` or `__` have the same effect as bold while the former is usually preferred. TeXSmith uses the latter for small capitals when the `texsmith.smallcaps`
extension is enabled.

```md
This is __small capitals__.
```

> This is __small capitals__.

## Advanced Syntax Extensions (Non-Standard)

### Tables

```md

> | Value 1 | Value 2 |
> | Value 3 | Value 4 |

### Footnotes

A footnote[^2] is a note placed at the bottom of the page.

### Long Dash (—)

_Description: Notes how em-dashes are handled differently by parsers._

No current extension automatically handles the em dash in Markdown. In LaTeX you use `--` for an en dash and `---` for an em dash. The `---` sequence can be confusing in Markdown because it is also used for horizontal rules; however, some parsers such as `markdown-it-py` interpret it contextually. Experiment as needed.

Achiles -- the swifest runner -- was fast, but not as fast as the tortoise.
```

> Achiles -- the swifest runner -- was fast, but not as fast as the tortoise.

> [!note] This is a note.
> Used on Docusaurus, Obsidian, GitHub.
