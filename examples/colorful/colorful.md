## Northwest

In the age of AI, our greatest power is not computation -- but compassion.
Let us rise above the machines we create, and redefine what it means to be human.

## Northeast

The planet is speaking through storms and silence. Climate change is our final
reminder: protect the world that protects us, before the last leaf falls.

## Southwest

We invented technology to connect souls -- not isolate them. In the glow of
progress, choose presence, choose people, choose purpose.

## Southeast

The future is not written in code or carbon. It is shaped by every act of
courage we dare today. Humanity’s masterpiece is still ahead.
