# Introduction

Boobies are seabirds in the genus *Sula*, family Sulidae. They are
large, long-winged birds that plunge-dive for fish. The name "booby"
originates from the Spanish word "bobo", meaning "stupid" or "clown",
due to the birds' apparent lack of fear of humans.

## Particularities

Boobies have several distinctive features:

- They have brightly colored feet, which they use in mating displays.
- They are known for their spectacular diving ability, plunging into
  the water from great heights to catch fish.
