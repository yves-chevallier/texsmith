# Abbreviations

In modern chemical analysis, techniques like NMR, FTIR, and GC-MS are essential for identifying compounds, while methods such as HPLC and ICP-OES provide high-precision quantification of analytes across a wide range of matrices. Researchers often rely on computational tools like DFT and Molecular Dynamics to model reaction pathways and molecular behavior, supported by data from X-ray Diffraction for crystalline structure determination.
